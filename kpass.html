    <p>KPass is the best KeePass password manager for Android. It supports reading and modification of KDBX 3 and 4
        files.</p>
    <p>We have reached the time when a password can be the main value, more expensive than money, gold and brilliants.
        Let's say the password for a bank account gives you access to all the money at once, YouTube password — access
        to all subscribers eyes, and password for a cloud service is key to your private docs.</p>
    <p>Top advice: generate good complex passwords and change them from time to time.</p>
    <p>KPass offers secure storage for your passwords, addresses, bank card details, private notes and syncs them across
        all your devices — giving you faster access to your online accounts, apps and important information.</p>
